Debug and Release configurations should work. 

AUDIO:
This codebase uses the Doom 3 BFG audio system. To get audio in Doom 3 retail, first extract pak003 to your base folder, open up sound/convert.bat and fix the file paths. Then run convert.bat and wait about 10 minutes :). This will be fixed in a future release.
